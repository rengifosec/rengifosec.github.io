Having recently graduated from WGU with a Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity, I’m excited to take the next step in sharpening and showcasing my penetration testing skills. To do this, I’ve started the **Bug Bounty Learning Path** on Hack The Box.

This structured path offers hands-on challenges and practical scenarios that align with real-world bug bounty hunting. My goal is to build on my existing knowledge while honing the technical expertise required to identify and exploit vulnerabilities effectively.

Through this journey, I’ll share my progress, insights, and lessons learned, not only as a way to track my development but also to contribute to the broader cybersecurity community.

## Why Bug Bounty?

Bug bounty hunting offers an excellent opportunity to apply penetration testing skills in dynamic, high-stakes environments. It’s a field that requires creativity, technical acumen, and continuous learning—qualities I’m eager to cultivate further.

Stay tuned for updates as I progress through the learning path and work toward mastering the key aspects of bug bounty hunting.
